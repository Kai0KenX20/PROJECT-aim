# Controller Input Method

The project supports controller-based input for aiming. To enable it, set the following in `config.ini`:

```
input_method = CONTROLLER
```

When using a controller, the right-stick movement can be scaled with:

```
controller_sensitivity = <float>
```

Higher values increase the stick output for the same aim adjustment. The default value is `1.0`.
